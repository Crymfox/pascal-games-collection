# Pascal Games Collection

This repository contains two ASCII-based games that I developed during my high school years (2016-2017) using the Pascal programming language, specifically on Turbo Pascal for Windows (TPW). The games are:

- **Sudoku**: A classic puzzle game where you fill a 9x9 grid so that each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid contains all digits from 1 to 9.
- **Snake**: The traditional Snake game where you control a snake to eat food, growing longer with each piece eaten, while avoiding collisions with the walls and yourself.

## A Blast from the Past: The Pre-AI Era

These projects were crafted in a time before the widespread AI and coding assistants that we see today. Every line of code was written by hand, guided by nothing but logic, determination, and a passion for programming. No AI, no code suggestions—just pure, old-school problem-solving.

As someone who has witnessed the evolution of technology firsthand, it's fascinating to see how far we've come. But there's a certain nostalgia and pride in knowing that these games were born in an era where code was written purely by the human mind, without the influence of AI tools that are now prevalent in our development environments.

## Games

### Sudoku
- **Description**: A simple implementation of Sudoku with an ASCII-based interface.
- **How to Play**: The player fills in numbers on the grid, ensuring no number repeats in any row, column, or 3x3 subgrid.
- **Controls**: Use the keyboard to input numbers into the grid.

### Snake
- **Description**: The classic Snake game implemented in an ASCII environment.
- **How to Play**: Control the snake to eat the food and grow, avoiding collisions with the walls and yourself.
- **Controls**: Use the arrow keys to control the snake's movement. (Just kidding use Q, Z, D, S to control pascal doesn't support arrow keys xP)

## How to Run These Games

To run these Pascal games, you'll need to use Turbo Pascal for Windows (TPW). Here’s a step-by-step guide:

### 1. **Download Turbo Pascal for Windows (TPW)**
   - Download TPW from this link: [Download TPW 1.5](https://www.mediafire.com/file/ec8xg06ivpac26y/TPW_1.5.rar/file).
   - Extract the `.rar` file using software like [WinRAR](https://www.win-rar.com/) or [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/).

### 2. **Install TPW**
   - Navigate to the extracted folder and run the `INSTALL.EXE` file to install Turbo Pascal for Windows.
   - **Note:** TPW only works on 32-bit Windows systems. If you're using a 64-bit version of Windows, you’ll need to run it in a 32-bit environment.

### 3. **Setting Up a 32-bit Environment**
   - **Option 1: Use a Virtual Machine (Recommended)**
     - Download and install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) or another VM software.
     - Create a new virtual machine with a 32-bit version of Windows (e.g., Windows XP or Windows 7 32-bit).
     - Install TPW inside the VM and proceed with the steps below.
   - **Option 2: Use Windows Virtual PC with Windows XP Mode**
     - **Windows XP Mode**: This is a virtual Windows XP environment that runs within Windows 7 Professional, Enterprise, or Ultimate. It’s specifically designed to run older applications that require a 32-bit environment.
     - **Steps**:
       1. Download and install [Windows Virtual PC](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=3702) and [Windows XP Mode](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8002).
       2. Set up Windows XP Mode by following the on-screen instructions.
       3. Once set up, install TPW inside the Windows XP Mode environment.
       4. Proceed with opening and compiling the games as described below.

### 4. **Open and Compile the Games**
   - Once TPW is installed and running:
     1. Open TPW and navigate to `File > Open`.
     2. Select the `.PAS` file for either **Sudoku** or **Snake**.
     3. Compile the program by selecting `Run > Compile`.
     4. After compiling, you can run the game directly within TPW.

### 5. **Reproduce the Original Binaries**
   - The compiled binaries (executable files) should now be available. They should match the original binaries included in this repository.
   - You can now play the games directly from these binaries or share them with others!

## Acknowledgments
These games represent an important milestone in my programming journey, crafted entirely by hand before the advent of AI coding assistants. They serve as a reminder of the power of human creativity and problem-solving in the world of programming.
